Driver Drowsiness Detection System

Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a Python-based application designed to monitor the alertness of drivers using facial landmark detection. It aims to enhance road safety by alerting drivers when they show signs of drowsiness, thereby reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.

Features
- Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses a webcam to capture live video and detect driver drowsiness in real-time.
- Facial Landmark Detection**: Utilizes `dlib` and OpenCV to track facial landmarks for effective eye state analysis.
- Alert System**: Sends visual and auditory alerts when drowsiness is detected, ensuring the driver remains aware and alert.
- User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Tkinter for a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing capabilities)
- dlib (for facial landmark detection)
- Tkinter (for creating the graphical user interface)
- PyMySQL (for user registration and login)

Download Dlib's Pretrained Model:
Download the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file from here.
Extract the .dat file and place it in the project directory.
